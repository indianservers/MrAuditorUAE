# Native source adapters and VAT engine bridge

Implementation checkpoint: 24 October 2026. These additions extend the existing evidence, intelligence job, immutable event, review and lineage infrastructure.

## Supported profiles

- CAMT.053: namespace versions 02, 04, 08–13, booked account entries, one complete selected statement. Original opening/closing balances, currency, account, references and dates remain attached. Nested transaction details are not counted twice. Incomplete paginated statements are rejected.
- SWIFT MT940: one complete final-balance statement, including reversal direction and year rollover. Intermediate balances, multiple pages and unsupported tags are rejected rather than silently dropped.
- UAE WPS SIF: the explicit ten-field EDR/SCR profile, employee records followed by one employer trailer. Filename, employer, employee, account, routing, period, count and amount controls are checked. A SIF instruction never proves payment execution. Other bank-specific variants require additional adapters.
- Existing UAE VAT201 engine: current, reconciled calculations become `return-boxes` sources without re-keying or recalculating VAT rates. Reviewed manual tax adjustments remain separate from base tax. Calculation dependencies propagate staleness; filed-return evidence must still be imported independently. Aggregate box 1 does not establish an emirate-level comparison.

Uploads remain subject to clean retained evidence, private storage, hash verification, explicit external row/amount controls and independent source review. Structured uploads are bounded to 10 MiB and 5,000 rows. XML uses entity/DTD protection. Native parsing verifies file consistency, not account ownership or legal compliance.

The results screen exposes original source controls and calculation basis. Available formats are country gated; WPS and the VAT bridge require a UAE engagement. Access to the VAT bridge also requires VAT read permission, including when its results are consumed downstream.

## Verification receipts

- `workflow-regression-results.xml`: 275 backend tests across reconciliation, shared audit, practice, sector, diligence, native parsing and the VAT bridge at this checkpoint.
- `native-integration-results.xml`: four native upload/evidence/job tests with real HTTP, PostgreSQL and private object storage.
- `vat-bridge-integration-results.xml`: VAT workbench calculation → source event, calculation lineage, choice listing and invalidation after reopening an invoice.

Integration tests use explicit scanner and broker doubles; they do not qualify a production scanner or prove a live bank integration. Synthetic examples are not consented client pilots. Frontend type checking and five workflow component tests passed at this checkpoint. No new native-adapter browser acceptance claim is made here.

## Remaining work

Representative bank exports and production WPS variants still need qualification. PDF/OCR bank statements, customs imports, India native GST/IMS/withholding/ECR/ESIC formats, live registries and professional country release gates remain open. This checkpoint does not close the full original roadmap.
